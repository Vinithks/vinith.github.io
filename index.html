									End to End Project</a></h2>
									<p>The Housing Price Prediction End-to-End Project is a machine learning project that predicts housing prices based on various features. It uses a dataset of housing prices, machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, and follows an end-to-end approach covering data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and deployment. Python and various machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib are used for data processing, model training, and visualization, and Flask is used for deployment. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting housing prices and provides a comprehensive example of the end-to-end machine learning workflow.</p>

									<p>"Face Mask Detection using Tensor Flow" is a computer vision project that uses pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 to detect whether an individual is wearing a face mask or not. The project aims to compare the accuracy of different pre-trained models and determine which one provides the most accurate results. <br />
										The project uses TensorFlow for model training and evaluation on a dataset of images of people wearing or not wearing masks. The project presents the results in a comparative analysis of the accuracy of each pre-trained model and shows that InceptionV3 provided the most accurate results for detecting face masks.

									<p>Stock Price Prediction of Tata Global using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and TensorFlow can be a machine learning model that forecasts future stock prices of Tata Global Beverages Limited. LSTM is a type of deep learning neural network that is well-suited for time series data, such as stock prices. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that can be used to build and train LSTM models.<br />
										In this scenario, the model would be trained on historical stock prices of Tata Global Beverages. The LSTM network would use this information to learn patterns in the stock price data and make predictions about future prices. The model's predictions can be visualized and compared to actual stock prices to evaluate its accuracy. This information can then be used by investors, traders, and analysts to make informed decisions about buying or selling Tata Global Beverages stock.</p>

									<p>Breast Cancer Classification using a Simple Neural Network with Historical Diagnosis Data is a machine learning model designed to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on patient data. This data can include factors such as age, family history, and results from other diagnostic tests. The neural network is trained on a dataset of past patient diagnoses, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between patient data and breast cancer diagnosis.<br />
										The simple neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the patient data, and each hidden layer processes the information and passes it to the next layer. The output layer produces the final diagnosis, which can be either benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The neural network is trained using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, that adjusts the weights of the connections between the layers to minimize the error between the predicted and actual diagnoses.<br />
